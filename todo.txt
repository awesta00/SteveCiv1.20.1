Encampment fixes:
lecturn starts at page 3 (not page 1)
add captain once made?
Make new block entity as banner?

The structures will spawn randomly as normal
No longer will they spawn near the player.
Instead, only the banner markers will spawn

Paratrooper:
-spawn in and fly toward player with elytra/rocket

if have target (player):
    -jump->engage elytra -> rocket at upward angle towards them
    .

Engineer:
-scan for blocks like fences, doors, etc (entrance blocks) and place/ignite tnt
    -if not entrance blocks, search for wall blocks (stone bricks, etc) to place tnt
    -TNT ONLY AFFECTS TARGETTED BLOCKS
    -Make targetting blocks better (closest one!! Can also be slightly randomized so in armies they don't all target 1 point)
    -he only runs away 1 direction????

make it so steve can place ladders and break blocks above him
add a hunter with super good pvp
